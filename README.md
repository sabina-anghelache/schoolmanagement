# Java JDBC Example: Student Management System
This Java program demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to manage a student management system. The system retrieves data from tables such as student, teacher, and classes in the MySQL database named student_management. It provides functionality to display student details, calculate earnings, manage teacher information, and list available courses.

# Features
Database Connection: Establishes a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC.
Student Management: Retrieves student details from the student table including name, surname, contact information, courses enrolled, and fees paid.
Teacher Management: Retrieves teacher details from the teacher table including name, surname, contact information, courses taught, and salary.
Course Management: Retrieves information about available courses from the classes table including course name, professor, and room.

# Dependencies
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
MySQL Database: Set up a MySQL database named student_management with appropriate tables (student, teacher, classes) and populate them with sample data.
